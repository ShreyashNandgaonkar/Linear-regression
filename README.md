# Linear-regression
Linear regression is a statiscal model that examines a linear relationship between two variables, dependant and an independant variable.
Linear relationship means if one variable increases (decreases), other will also increase (decrease). 
Linear relationship can be both positive and negative.
Maths in hood.  y = mx + b, y is the dependant variable, x is the independant variable (used for prediction) and 'm' is the slope of regression line.
For multiple linear regression (MLR), y = b0 + b1x1i + b2x2i

I have used sklearn to implement linear regression on Boston dataset for predicting house pricing.
